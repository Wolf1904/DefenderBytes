DefenderBytes Antivirus Scanner
===============================

Overview
---------

DefenderBytes is a simple antivirus scanner application developed in Java. It allows users to scan files and directories for known malware by checking their SHA256 hashes against a list of known malicious hash codes. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Swing, providing a user-friendly way to perform scans, view logs, and check infected files.

Features
--------

- **Scan**: Allows the user to scan a selected file or directory.
- **Full Scan**: Performs a comprehensive scan of the entire file system.
- **Scan Logs**: Opens a file containing the logs of previous scans.
- **Infected Files**: Opens a file listing detected infected files.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Java 11 or later
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) (for building the project, if used)

- `SHA256.java`: Utility class for calculating SHA256 checksums of files.
- `text_files/`:
  - `scanlogs.txt`: File where scan logs are saved.
  - `infected.txt`: File where detected infected files are listed.
  - `hashcodes.txt`: File containing known malicious hash codes.
